          The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (&quot;KSA&quot;) has introduced an
          electronic visa service (&quot;eVisa&quot;). The eVisa is a
          multi-entry electronic travel authorization that allows citizens from
          eligible countries to visit KSA for a short-term stay. The eVisa has
          been designed to speed up the process of getting a visa for KSA. The
          eVisa service is operated by Ministry of Tourism, 7775 Amr Al Damri
          Street Assafarat Dist. Riyadh 12512-3135 P.O. Box 66680 Riyadh 11586
